No backend is required, beyond that provided by App.net. To add comments to a page, just add a few lines of JavaScript and an App.net post ID to use as the comment tree root.\r\n\r\nCommentary is a work in progress. At the moment, it only supports logging in and out, with no additional functionality. "}
